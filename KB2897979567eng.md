DO NOT EDIT PHP-files manually. Because there are a lot of technical questions you need to resolve. Alteration of the files may cause Glossword to malfunction.

The most common errors:

  * Incorrect encoding (must be UTF-8 without [Byte Order Mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark));

  * HTML-entities instead of Unicode characters (ex. "Compatibilit&agrave;" instead of "Compatibilità");

  * Missed characters (ex. "Termini inizianti con ?%s?'" instead of "Termini inizianti con ‘%s’");

  * Incorrect markup (ex "`"<em>ab*</em>"`" instead of "`&quot;<em>ab*</em>&quot;`");

  * Unnecessary "Line feed" character in the end of files (ex. "\x3F\x3E\x0D\x0A" instead of "\x3F\x3E", \x3F is hexademical value for `?` and \x3E is `>`). ![http://glossword.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/correct-wrong-eof.png](http://glossword.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/correct-wrong-eof.png)

_However, it is possible to avoid some errors by using Unicode-compatible text editor. For example EmEditor, Notepad++, SC UniPad._


Instead of editing PHP-files, download archive with source phrases in MS Excel format:

It is easy to edit. You have two columns - "Source" and "Target".
Write your translation variant into the "Target".

Save and send MS Excel files to email team at glossword dot biz.
Later than I'll send you working PHP-files with translation.
If you will have a questions during translation process, please ask them to me.

If you are using **OpenOffice** (Calc), open MS Excel files as **Microsoft Excel 2003 XML**. Save edited files in this file format.


### Translation example ###

Here is the fragment of `global.xls`:

| ID | Source | Target |
|:---|:-------|:-------|
| 1277 | An interesting page |  |
| select\_off | Uncheck all |  |

To translate it, for example, to Spanish, make this section looks like:

| ID | Source | Target |
|:---|:-------|:-------|
| 1277 | An interesting page | Una página interesante |
| select\_off | Uncheck all | Desmarcar todos |

Save the file and translation is complete.

_Perhaps, there are will be no translation files at all in the next Glossword version 1.8.x. Everything will be stored in database. It will allow to create translations faster and easier._
