## What is custom page? ##

"Custom page" feature allows administrator to create and modify new pages for Glossword, in addition to pages "Top 10" and "Feedback". Pages are nested, and they have a tree structure. It means some pages (childs) could be placed under another pages (parents).

Beginning from version 1.7.0 Glossword allows to include custom PHP-code with your custom page.

Beginning from version 1.8.0 Glossword allows to export and import all custom pages at once. So you can transfer all the site contents with a click.

## What variables could be used in a custom page? ##

There are some PHP-variables which could be used in PHP-code:

  * `$ar_tpl_construct` Array. HTML-template names for visual theme. Each page of visual theme consists several HTML-templates.
  * `$gw_this` Array. Allowed values received from $_GET and $_POST, the list of dictionaries with their settings.
  * `$oDb` Object. Database class.

## Where are code examples for custom page? = ##

The following example adds new variable `block:dict_updated` to HTML-templates with the list of recently updated dictionaries:
```
$oTpl->addVal( 'block:dict_updated', 
   gw_html_block_small( $oL->m('r_dict_updated'), 
     getTop10('DICT_UPDATED', $sys['max_dict_top'], 0)
   ) 
);
```

Includes the contents of HTML-file:

```
$arV['page_content'] = $oFunc->file_get_contents('templates/common/gw_info1.html');
$oTpl->addVal( 'block:', $arV['page_content']);
```

  * `$arV['page_content']` - pre-defined variable.
  * `$oFunc->file_get_contents()` - function to read file contents.
  * `$oTpl->addVal()` - function to add a variable into HTML-templates.
