### How to add a lot of terms at once? ###

  1. From title page: Browse for dictionaries "Dictionary -> Browse", select topic, then select "Import" opposite the dictionary name.
  1. From dictionary editing page: Select "Dictionary -> Import". Paste CVS- or XML-code into HTML-form on "Importing dictionary data" page, click on "Save".
  1. _Since 1.8.7:_ From title page: Select "Terms -> Import". Select a dictionary.

Recommended number of terms which could be added at once is 500.
It varies depending on server performance.

The process of importing terms is a complicated task. There are a lot of
transformations with text during the process. You can import 10.000 terms on a local
machine. But web-server, especially shared hosting, allows to import 500 terms or
less at best results.
