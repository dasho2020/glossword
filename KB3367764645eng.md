### Why I'm receiving message "HTTP 500.0 - Internal Server Error. The FastCGI process exceeded configured activity timeout."? ###

**Q:** I've started Glossword installation, but after setting up database connection properties I'm receiving the following:
```
HTTP 500.0 - Internal Server Error
The FastCGI process exceeded configured activity timeout.
Module: FastCgiModule
```

**A:** Use `127.0.0.1` as database host name instead of the default `localhost`. Also, make sure database exists. You may check MySQL connection using [MySQL Administrator](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/).
