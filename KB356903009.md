### How to use a back-up files? ###

Let me give you a short introduction into database administration course.
```
INSERT INTO `gw_abbr` VALUES ('161','1','0','1');
INSERT INTO `gw_settings` VALUES (0x63616368655f7a6c6962,0x30);
INSERT INTO `gw_topics` VALUES (0x31,'1','10','0','1150830258','1151237086','');
```

This is SQL-dump, a file with database commands. These files could be
very large, for example, the commands for dictionary with 50.000 terms
could take 30 MBytes or more. You can't upload it with browser unless you
have a broadband Internet connection. But in the most cases, a hosting provider
just will not allow you to upload such big files with its database administration
tool (phpMyAdmin or custom). The general purpose of SQL-dump is to import
it using a command line:

```
# mysql database_name -u username -p < dumpfile.sql
```

The most of hosting companies provides information about how to use
a command line interface (via SSH) for their clients.
A cheap hosting does not have command line interface at all, usually.
