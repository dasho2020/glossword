### How to synchronize dictionary content between local and remote installations? ###

  * The most suitable method: Export data into XML on your local machine, log in to remote machine then import XML-file.
  * Second method, faster to import large databases (more than 10 000 terms):
    1. Export data into SQL without keywords. You will get dictionary content.
    1. Export data into SQL but now keywords only. You will get large file with keywords.
    1. Import `.sql` files which includes raw SQL-commands into database using your favorite database manager (phpMyAdmin, for example) or upload them to your server and use the command line:
```
#mysql database -u username -p < dumpfile.sql
```
> Since version 1.6.2, Glossword allows to create very large SQL-dumps (more that 100 000 terms) in very nice and suitable way because one file is splitted into small parts. The number of lines in each part is configurable.
