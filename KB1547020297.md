### What is unsearchable? ###

  * All HTML-tags and HTML-entitles, like &amp;, &#160; and so on.
  * All special characters like `!@#$%^&*()/\` and so on.
  * All words shorter than minimum search length. Default is 2 characters. The minimum search length can be defined in dictionary settings.
  * Common words like `the, an, to` are unsearchable also. The list of common words depends on dictionary language. See also `/gw_locale/{locale_name}/common_words.php`.
