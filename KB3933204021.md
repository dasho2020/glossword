### How to update from 1.7.0 to 1.8.4 ###

Method one: export all terms into XML format in version 1.7.0, make a clean install of 1.8.4 and import XML-files into 1.8.4.

_Note:_ There is an issue with exporting terms in 1.7.0 - a short date range. This has been fixed, see file [inc-for-exporting-1.7.0.zip](http://groups.google.com/group/glossword/files?hl=en)

For 1.7.0 it is possible to update to 1.8.3. The script to update from old versions exists prior to 1.8.3.

  1. use version 1.8.3
    * run `/gw_install/install.php`
