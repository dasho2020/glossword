### Is it possible to change charset encoding? ###

  * The charset used in Glossword is common for all dictionaries and it is UTF-8 (Unicode). `ISO-*` charsets are old-fasioned, obsoleted by Unicode and will be not used for multilingual software on market in future. So I recommend to use UTF-8. The answer is **no** because the changing of charset is useless.


  * Possible from version 1.6.3. But you will lost the most of multilingual functionality. See file `/inc/config.inc.php`, variable `$sys['internal_encoding'] = 'UTF-8';`.
> Russian and English:
```
$sys['internal_encoding'] = 'windows-1251';
```
> English only:
```
$sys['internal_encoding'] = 'ISO-8859-1';
```
> After changing charset encoding all terms with non-latin characters should be imported or edited again.
