### What is "anti-leecher"? ###

Anti-leecher in Glossword is the way how links to terms are generated. It is available in the dictionary settings.

By default, an URL to the term looks as follows:

```
/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=123
```

Where `1` is Dictionary ID and `123` is Term ID. The user (leecher) can automatically generate links to download all your dictionary:

```
/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=1
/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=2
/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=3
etc.
```

To prevent that, Glossword generates a random number for Term ID:

```
/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=1
/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=3
/index.php?a=term&d=1&t=7
```

It makes an automatic download longer.

### Why one should activate that? ###

With enabled "Anti-leacher" it is impossible to generate Term IDs because links are constructed by another way:

```
/index.php?a=term&t=a3a25ea7539e5671a39b6ba559a3575b
```

So the user (leecher) can't download your dictionary automatically.
Dictionary ID is invisible also.


### How does it work? ###

When "Anti-leecher" is turned on, the dictionary is protected against an automatic downloaders. Glossword increases the amount of pages in 2 times. This parameter is configurable in `/inc/config.inc.php`:
```
$sys['leech_factor'] = 2;
```

When set to 5, the process of downloading by software will never end. "Anti-leecher" generates 5 different variants of links to term per each dictionary page request.

Do not set it too high. As there are several links to the same term, it produces "duplicate content" problem with search engines.


The feature "Anti-leecher" is available since version 1.3.3 (July 25, 2002).

The ability use a custom URLs for terms is available since version 1.8.5 (September 22, 2007).
