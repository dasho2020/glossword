### Why I'm receiving message "403 Permission Denied"? ###

**Q:** When I start with `http://mydomain/glossword/gw_install`,
I have the following message:

```
403 Permission Denied
You do not have permission for this request
```

**A:** Try to rename or remove file `/glossword/.htaccess`.

Also, there is shortcut to installation: `/glossword/install.php`.
