### Troubleshooting "Allowed memory size of n bytes exhausted" ###

**Q:** When I'm trying to import or export or backup dictionary data, I'm receiving the following message:

```
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of _n_ bytes exhausted (tried to allocate _n_ bytes) in _filename_ on line _ n_.
```

**A:** For Import and Export: try to reduce the number of terms you are trying to import or export.

**A:** For Backup: Try to clear the history of changes before making a backup.
Follow "System settings" -> "Maintenance" -> "Clear the history of changes".

**A:** Your hosting service does not allow to use more memory. You can backup dictionary data manually using database administration tool like phpMyAdmin.
