### How to add a new field? ###

It is not so easy to add a field. There are many transformation rules
for each field. HTML-forms are defined in `/inc/class.gw_htmlforms.php`.
Front-end rendering is defined in `/lib/class.render.php`. This file is also used
to construct XML-code for storing a dictionary entry.

To disable some fields, you can open `/inc/constants.php`, scroll down to
`$arFields` and comment out a line with field configuration. For example:

```
# 9  => array('address', 'textarea', 'auto', 0,  0, 14),
# 10 => array('phone',   'textarea', 'auto', 0,  0, 15),
```

It will disable fields `Address` and `Phone`.
