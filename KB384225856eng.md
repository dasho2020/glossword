### Why I'm receiving message "HTTP 404.11 - Not Found. The request filtering module is configured to deny a request that contains a double escape sequence"? ###

**Q:** When I start with `http://127.0.0.1/glossword/1.8/index.php/list/Example+dictionary.xhtml`,
I have the following message:

```
HTTP 404.11 - Not Found.
The request filtering module is configured to deny a request that contains a double escape sequence
Module: RequestFilteringModule
```

**A:** It happen when you have configured Glossword to use SEF-mode (Search engine friendly URLs). By default, IIS 7.0 rejects URLs with a double escape sequence. Open file `web.config` and set `allowDoubleEscaping`:
```
<system.webServer>
    ...
    <security>
        <requestFiltering allowDoubleEscaping="true"/>
    </security>
    ...
</system.webServer>
```
