### How to make a back-up? ###

Since 1.8.3, there is a special maintenance task: System -> Maintenance -> Backup

It is divided into four steps:

  1. Export all program settings (also visual themes, custom pages).
  1. Export dictionary contents.
  1. Export keywords for search engine.
  1. Export keywords-to-term assignments for internal search engine.

Directories with SQL-dumps are named so that it is easy
to track changes. For example, files for the current date will
be saved into `sql_backup_2007-08Aug-21`.
